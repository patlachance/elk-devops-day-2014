# The configuration file needs to define the sources, 
# the channels and the sinks.
# Sources, channels and sinks are defined per agent, 
# in this case called 'agent'

agent.sources = source-1
agent.channels = channel-1
agent.sinks = sink-1

# For each one of the sources, the type is defined
agent.sources.source-1.type = seq

# The channel can be defined as follows.
agent.sources.source-1.channels = channel-1

# Each sink's type must be defined
agent.sinks.sink-1.type = logger

#Specify the channel the sink should use
agent.sinks.sink-1.channel = channel-1

# Each channel's type is defined.
agent.channels.channel-1.type = memory

# Other config values specific to each type of channel(sink or source)
# can be defined as well
# In this case, it specifies the capacity of the memory channel
agent.channels.channel-1.capacity = 20000
